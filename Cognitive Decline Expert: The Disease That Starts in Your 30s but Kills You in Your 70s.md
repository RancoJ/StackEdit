Alzheimer’s disease are mostly preventable, only 5% are triggered by genetics.

It develops in 30s and symptoms shows up in 60s – 70s.

Higher VO2Max have greater “reserve” to overcome stress.

Higher cognitive capacity can protect the brain later in life from harmful insults like toxic protein build-ups, small strokes, inflammation, and age-related cell loss.  This means symptoms may appear later or be less severe, even when brain damage is present.

Huntington’s disease is a rare, inherited brain disorder that causes progressive loss of movement control, thinking, and emotional regulation. It is caused by a faulty gene that leads to toxic protein build-up in brain cells, which gradually die over time.

Higher cognitive capacity means more brain connections.

Novelty builds brain connections.

Brain connections will fail over time, when you don’t use them.

Preserve brain connections: Exercise, Reading and handwriting. Resistance training has the best result.

The APOE e4 gene increases Alzheimer’s risk because it makes the brain less efficient at clearing harmful proteins like amyloid. This leads to greater protein build-up, more inflammation and reduced repair of brain cells over time.

A UK twin study found that leg power predicts cognitive ageing, despite controlling the common genetics and early life environment shared by twins, interventions targeted to improve leg power may help reach a universal goal of healthy cognitive ageing.

The one-repetition max (1RM) is the maximum amount of weight you can lift once with proper form. For example, if your bench press 1RM is 100kg, you would need to lift 80kg in your sets, for the neural benefits.

Cytokines are proteins that help regulate immune responses. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes inflammation during illness, which helps the body fight infections by increasing blood flow and mobilizing immune cells.

High IL-6 levels are linked to cancer growth, however, exercise-induced IL-6, released by the muscles, reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and slows tumour growth. Short-term IL-6 spikes from exercise are beneficial, while chronically high IL-6 levels are harmful.

Recommendation:

Air squat 10 times every hour for 8 times. Benefits out weight 30mins power walk.

Lactate threshold is the point during exercise when lactate begins to accumulate in the bloodstream faster than It can be cleared. It’s often used as an indicator of endurance – higher lactate thresholds typically indicate better aerobic capacity, meaning you are fitter.

BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) is a protein that supports the growth and maintenance of brain cells (neurons). It also helps with neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to forming new neural connections and adapt to new experiences.

Increasing VO2Max:

The Norwegian 4x4 is 4-minute intervals of intense exercise at 90-95% of maximum effort, followed by 3-4 minutes of rest. The workout is typically repeated 4 times, and improves endurance and aerobic capacity.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a protective layer of cells around the brain’s blood vessels. It controls what substances can pass from the blood into the brain, ensuring harmful substances are blocked and necessary nutrients can enter, keeping the brain safe.

Dementia is the leading cause of death for women in the UK, a position it has held consistently since 2011. It has also become the leading cause of death in Australia, overtaking heart disease. In the US, it is ranked the 6th leading cause of death.

The keto diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to shift the body’s metabolism into ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. The diet is often used for weight loss, but it may also have benefits fro certain medical conditions like epilepsy.

The myelin sheath is a specialized, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axons (nerve fibers) of neurons. It acts as a protective, accelerating layer that allows electrical impulses to travel rapidly and efficiently between neurons.

During perimenopause, lower estrogen levels make it harder for the brain to use glucose for energy, creating and “energy gap”. This can lead to brain fog, fatigue, and memory problems, as the brain struggles to get the energy it needs, even with sufficient food intake.

Findings on the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on Alzheimer’s disease and dementia risk vary depending on the timing of initiation, hormone formulation, and study design. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships.

Tau protein helps stabilize microtubules in brain cells, supporting cell structure and nutrient transport. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes abnormal and forms tangles, disrupting brain cell function and contributing to memory loss and cognitive decline.

Lack of sleep cannot be compensated by longer sleep during weekend.

Supplements Gaba helps stabilize the mind to allow getting to sleep.

Eat starchy food at night helps getting to sleep.

Lower body temperature is required for sleep. Supplementing Glycin also helps, it also has benefits of improving longevity. Ashwaganda helps with stress, it is an adaptogen regulating cortisol.

### Key Insights and Core Concepts

- **Alzheimer’s disease overview:**
  - Alzheimer's is a **preventable neurodegenerative disease**, often beginning silently in midlife (starting in the 30s) with symptoms appearing decades later (60s-70s).
  - It is not primarily a genetic disease; **95% of cases could be prevented** through lifestyle modifications.
  - Women represent 70% of Alzheimer's cases, with being female itself a significant risk factor beyond longevity.

- **Brain anatomy and function:**
  - The brain contains approximately 87 billion neurons, each with 5,000 to 10,000 connections.
  - Cognitive reserve—the brain’s ability to withstand damage—is built by creating and maintaining these connections through learning, reading, handwriting, and especially **regular exercise**.
  - The **cerebellum** and the **anterior midcingulate cortex (AMCC)** are crucial for motor control, willpower, and cognitive resilience.

- **Lifestyle factors impacting brain health:**
  - **Exercise** is paramount, particularly:
    - **Resistance training (strength training)** at ~80% of one-rep max to build muscle and stimulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), myokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
    - **High-intensity interval training (HIIT)** (zone 3-5) offers greater brain and heart benefits than moderate zone 2 cardio, especially for women.
    - Leg strength is specifically linked to larger brain volume and better cognition, validated by twin studies.
  - Sedentary behavior is a **disease state**; even small interventions like 10 air squats every hour can mitigate risks.
  - **Sleep** is a critical but underrated factor; deep sleep activates the glymphatic system that clears amyloid beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s.
  - **Stress management** and hormone regulation (notably estrogen in women) influence brain health and disease risk.

- **Genetics and biomarkers:**
  - APOE gene variants influence Alzheimer’s risk:
    - APOE E4 raises risk by 2-3 times per copy; females with E4 have a 6-fold to 15-fold increased risk.
    - APOE E2 is protective.
  - Modern blood tests can detect early Alzheimer’s biomarkers (tau protein, amyloid beta) with high accuracy.

- **Diet and supplementation:**
  - The brain’s primary fuel is glucose; during menopause, a 30% reduction in brain glucose metabolism occurs, contributing to cognitive decline and “brain fog.”
  - **Ketogenic diets** or ketone supplementation provide an alternative brain fuel and may benefit menopausal women and patients with Alzheimer’s.
  - **Creatine supplementation** (higher doses than traditionally used for muscles) shows promise in improving brain energy metabolism, cognitive function, and exercise capacity in Alzheimer’s patients, as well as protective effects against concussion, stroke, and cancer.
  - **Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA)** and **vitamin D** are crucial for brain cell membrane fluidity, anti-inflammatory effects, and cognitive preservation.
  - Proper storage and quality (e.g., NSF certification, oxidation level) of supplements like omega-3 are important.

- **Heart and vascular health:**
  - Cardiovascular health is tightly linked to brain health.
  - Exercise can **remodel the heart**, reversing aging effects by up to 20 years if started before age 65.
  - Managing blood pressure aggressively (target ~120/80 mmHg) preserves brain capillaries and cognitive function.
  - The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood primarily to the brain, making its health critical to cognitive longevity.

- **Brain disease pathology:**
  - Alzheimer’s involves extracellular **amyloid beta plaques** and intracellular **tau protein tangles**.
  - Amyloid beta is an antimicrobial peptide and not solely pathogenic; its accumulation is exacerbated by poor sleep.
  - Tau protein, when hyperphosphorylated, destabilizes neuronal microtubules, leading to neurodegeneration.
  - Declining estrogen removes inhibition on tau phosphorylation, increasing risk.

- **Cognitive training:**
  - Hand-eye coordination and reaction time exercises (e.g., tennis ball drills with eye patches) improve processing speed and cognitive reserve.
  - Challenging the brain with difficult tasks builds the AMCC, the brain’s "willpower muscle," associated with resilience and longevity.

- **Societal and emotional context:**
  - Women are underrepresented in research and healthcare, often neglecting their symptoms and needs.
  - The speaker’s personal motivation is deeply rooted in witnessing her grandmother’s cancer experience and seeing systemic failures.
  - Passion and obsession with brain health research come with personal sacrifices but are driven by a desire to empower people, especially women, to take control of their brain health.
  - Faith and spirituality are acknowledged as complementary to scientific understanding, especially in facing the limits of medicine.

### Practical Recommendations

- **Exercise regularly**, prioritizing resistance training at high intensity and incorporating HIIT sessions.
- **Avoid prolonged sitting**; interrupt sedentary periods with short bouts of movement such as air squats every hour.
- **Prioritize quality sleep** (7.5+ hours), manage sleep environment (temperature, light, supplements like GABA and glycine), and treat sleep disturbances seriously.
- **Consider hormone replacement therapy (HRT)** thoughtfully for menopausal women, as it may reduce Alzheimer's risk by improving sleep and muscle maintenance.
- **Supplement with creatine, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D** using high-quality products stored properly.
- **Engage in cognitively challenging activities** like reading, handwriting, and hand-eye coordination drills.
- **Manage cardiovascular health aggressively,** especially blood pressure, to protect brain vasculature.
- **Adopt ketogenic or ketone-rich diets** if experiencing metabolic brain crises (e.g., menopause or Alzheimer’s).
- **Get genetic testing (APOE) and biomarker screening** to assess risk and monitor early changes.
