### Summary

This in-depth discussion with biochemist Jesse Inchauspé, known as the "glucose goddess," centers on **how maternal diet during pregnancy programs a baby’s DNA**, impacting their development and lifelong health risks. Jesse highlights critical nutritional gaps in pregnancy diets, emphasizes the role of glucose management, and challenges common misconceptions about pregnancy nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle.

### Key Insights on Pregnancy Nutrition and Epigenetics

- **Maternal diet during pregnancy influences epigenetic programming**, which are chemical “dimmer switches” on DNA that activate or silence genes affecting baby's brain development and disease susceptibility.
- **Choline is essential for fetal brain development**, particularly for neurons involved in memory, learning, and attention. Yet, **90% of pregnant women do not consume enough choline**.
  - Eggs are the simplest, most affordable choline source; **four eggs daily provide the recommended 450 mg of choline**.
  - Organ meats like liver are rich in choline but often avoided due to vitamin A concerns.
- **High maternal glucose levels lead to epigenetic changes that increase offspring’s risk of diabetes, obesity, and psychiatric disorders**, shown by longitudinal studies including a UK sugar ration natural experiment.
- **Protein intake in pregnancy is critical; low protein diets cause smaller babies and may epigenetically program smaller muscle mass lifelong**.
  - In the third trimester, about 1.6 g protein per kg body weight per day is recommended, exemplified by eating approximately four chicken breasts daily.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, support fetal brain development and neuronal connectivity**.
  - Fatty fish (e.g., sardines) twice to thrice weekly plus DHA supplements are advised.
- **Sugar (fructose) from desserts and sweetened products should be avoided during pregnancy**, as babies need glucose but not fructose. Excessive sugar intake programs babies toward metabolic and mental health risks.
- **Breastfeeding provides live bioactive molecules that continue epigenetic programming**, unlike formula, which is inert. Formula should be checked for choline and omega-3 content.

### Glucose and Mood: Broader Health Implications

- Glucose is the brain’s primary energy source; **fluctuations cause mood instability, cravings, fatigue, and impaired decision-making**.
- Studies link glucose lows to increased irritability and even negative behaviors in relationships.
- Processed foods and engineered fruits lead to rapid glucose spikes and crashes, unlike ancestral diets.
- Glucose crashes impair the prefrontal cortex’s function, reducing willpower and increasing compulsive behaviors such as doom scrolling.
- The **protein leverage hypothesis** explains persistent hunger and cravings when protein intake is insufficient, driving people to seek sugar and carbs.

---

### Practical Glucose Management Hacks

- **Exercise, especially muscle contractions (e.g., calf raises, squats), post-meal reduces glucose spikes** by increasing muscle uptake of glucose.
- Moving within 90 minutes after eating can blunt glucose peaks.
- Eating vegetables before a meal slows glucose absorption due to fiber content.
- Standing desks alone do not significantly reduce glucose spikes compared to sitting.

---

### Exercise During Pregnancy

- Exercise is highly beneficial for fetal brain development; animal studies show offspring of exercising mothers perform better cognitively and show less anxiety.
- Exercise raises BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in both mother and fetus, supporting neuroplasticity.

### Other Pregnancy-Related Recommendations

| Topic                | Recommendation/Insight                                                 | Notes                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Alcohol              | Complete abstinence recommended; crosses placenta, toxic to fetal brain | Even low doses cause facial and brain changes |
| Caffeine             | Limit to 1-2 cups/day; no clear harmful effects at low doses          | High doses show some behavioral changes in animals |
| Fermented foods      | Early research suggests benefits for infant gut microbiome            | Include kefir, sauerkraut if possible     |
| Bread and carbs       | Baby needs about 70g additional glucose/day in third trimester         | Prefer seeded bread; starches preferred over sugars |
| Ketogenic diet        | Generally not recommended; baby requires glucose                       | Low glycemic diets preferred               |
| Supplements          | Omega-3 (DHA), choline, iron, methylated folate recommended            | Prenatal supplements should contain choline |

### Emotional and Psychological Aspects of Pregnancy

- Miscarriage affects ~20% of pregnancies; it is emotionally devastating and often silent.
- Pregnancy comes with social pressures and misinformation, leading to stress and anxiety.
- Jesse shares her personal experience with miscarriage and subsequent anxious pregnancy, emphasizing the need for support and education.
- Stress and poor sleep impact hunger hormones (leptin and ghrelin), further complicating glucose regulation and cravings.
- Understanding and managing cravings involves recognizing the difference between **pleasure-driven eating** and **biological sugar addiction** caused by glucose crashes.

---

### Food Industry and Systemic Challenges

- The current food system and marketing practices mislead consumers, especially pregnant women.
- Labels like “no added sugar,” “gluten-free,” or “vegan” can be deceptive; for example, fruit juices contain high natural sugars equaling soda.
- Only 6% of doctors discuss choline with pregnant patients despite its importance.
- Jesse advocates for systemic change, including better education, support for pregnant women, and regulation of misleading food marketing.
- She suggests banning fruit juice in schools and limiting sugary breakfast foods as impactful measures.

### Timeline of Pregnancy Nutritional Needs (Trimester Focus)

| Trimester       | Key Nutritional and Physiological Events                                     | Nutritional Focus                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| First trimester | Embryo implants; baby nourished by uterine secretions                       | Focus on establishing nutrient reserves; choline, folate essential |
| Second trimester| Placenta forms, enabling nutrient/waste exchange between mother and fetus   | Continue choline, protein, omega-3s; begin glucose monitoring |
| Third trimester | Rapid fetal growth; baby needs ~70g extra glucose/day; protein demand peaks | High protein intake (1.6 g/kg/day), glucose control, omega-3s, iron supplementation |

### Metaphor Summary

- Pregnancy is likened to **planting a seed in soil**: the baby’s DNA is the seed, and the mother’s body (nutrition and environment) is the soil.
- The quality of the soil directly influences the growth and health of the plant (baby), highlighting the mother’s agency in shaping fetal development.

---

### Closing Messages

- Pregnancy is a critical window with lifelong impact on the child’s health through epigenetic programming.
- Mothers have **agency and power** to influence their baby’s future by optimizing nutrition, managing glucose, exercising, and avoiding harmful substances.
- The current food environment makes this challenging, so **better education, support systems, and policy changes** are needed.
- Jesse’s book, *Nine Months That Count Forever: How Your Pregnancy Diet Shapes Your Baby’s Future*, aims to bridge the knowledge gap for parents and healthcare providers.
- The ultimate goal is to empower parents to make informed choices and reduce stress, promoting healthier outcomes for the next generation.
